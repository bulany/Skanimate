Creating a PDF for your drawing workflow is a great idea. It offers a simpler, file-based solution that avoids any web app complexities. It's quite easy to author a PDF from your folder of images using a scripting approach, particularly with a Python library like **Pillow** for image manipulation and **reportlab** for PDF generation. This process will take your images and automatically create a single, multi-page PDF with the required layout for each drawing day.

-----

### Step 1: Install Python and Libraries

First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries: `Pillow` for image processing and `reportlab` for PDF generation.

```bash
pip install Pillow
pip install reportlab
```

-----

### Step 2: Prepare the Images and Script

Organize your images in a folder. Let's assume you have 30 images named `output01.png`, `output02.png`, ..., `output30.png` in a directory called `images`.

Now, create a Python script, for example, `create_pdf.py`, in the same parent directory as your `images` folder.

### Step 3: The Python Script

The following script automates the PDF generation. It handles all the details: creating a blank page for the grid, placing the grid, resizing the image, overlaying the thin grid, and adding the page number text.

```python
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.lib.units import inch
from PIL import Image
import os

# --- Configuration ---
IMG_DIR = "images"
OUTPUT_PDF = "drawing_flipbook.pdf"
NUM_IMAGES = 30
GRID_DIVISIONS = 3
PAGE_SIZE = letter

# Grid dimensions and position
# Assuming a square grid in the center of the top half of a letter page
GRID_SIZE_INCH = 4.5
GRID_X_INCH = (8.5 - GRID_SIZE_INCH) / 2 # A letter page is 8.5 x 11 inches
GRID_Y_INCH = 11 - GRID_SIZE_INCH - 1.2 # Adjust this value to position the grid
GRID_LINE_THICKNESS = 4 # for black grid
OVERLAY_LINE_THICKNESS = 1 # for white grid

def create_pdf():
    c = canvas.Canvas(OUTPUT_PDF, pagesize=PAGE_SIZE)
    page_width, page_height = PAGE_SIZE

    # Calculate grid dimensions in Reportlab units (points)
    grid_size_pt = GRID_SIZE_INCH * inch
    grid_x_pt = GRID_X_INCH * inch
    grid_y_pt = GRID_Y_INCH * inch

    for i in range(1, NUM_IMAGES + 1):
        img_filename = f"output{i:02d}.png"
        img_path = os.path.join(IMG_DIR, img_filename)

        # Skip if image file doesn't exist
        if not os.path.exists(img_path):
            print(f"Warning: Image file not found: {img_path}. Skipping.")
            continue

        # --- Page 1: White page with black grid for tracing ---
        c.showPage() # Start new page
        
        # Draw the black grid
        c.setStrokeColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black
        c.setLineWidth(GRID_LINE_THICKNESS)
        
        step_size = grid_size_pt / GRID_DIVISIONS
        
        # Horizontal lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            y_pos = grid_y_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(grid_x_pt, y_pos, grid_x_pt + grid_size_pt, y_pos)
            
        # Vertical lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            x_pos = grid_x_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(x_pos, grid_y_pt, x_pos, grid_y_pt + grid_size_pt)
            
        # Add page number
        c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
        c.setFillColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black text
        page_text = f"{i}/{NUM_IMAGES}"
        text_width = c.stringWidth(page_text, "Helvetica", 14)
        c.drawString((page_width - text_width) / 2, grid_y_pt / 2, page_text)
        
        # --- Page 2: Image with white grid overlay ---
        c.showPage() # Start new page
        
        # Draw the image in the same position as the grid
        c.drawImage(img_path, grid_x_pt, grid_y_pt, width=grid_size_pt, height=grid_size_pt)

        # Draw the white grid overlay
        c.setStrokeColorRGB(1, 1, 1) # White
        c.setLineWidth(OVERLAY_LINE_THICKNESS)
        
        # Horizontal lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            y_pos = grid_y_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(grid_x_pt, y_pos, grid_x_pt + grid_size_pt, y_pos)
        
        # Vertical lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            x_pos = grid_x_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(x_pos, grid_y_pt, x_pos, grid_y_pt + grid_size_pt)
            
        # Add page number
        c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
        c.setFillColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black text
        text_width = c.stringWidth(page_text, "Helvetica", 14)
        c.drawString((page_width - text_width) / 2, grid_y_pt / 2, page_text)

    c.save()
    print(f"PDF '{OUTPUT_PDF}' created successfully with {NUM_IMAGES * 2} pages.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_pdf()
```

### How the Script Works:

1.  **Configuration:** The script starts with configurable variables at the top, allowing you to easily adjust the image directory, output file name, number of images, and grid size.
2.  **`create_pdf()` function:** This function is the core of the script.
      * It initializes a `canvas` object from `reportlab`, which is the foundation for drawing on the PDF.
      * It loops through your 30 images.
      * **Page 1 (Grid for Tracing):** It draws a new, blank page. Then, it sets the stroke color to black and the line thickness to a noticeable value (`GRID_LINE_THICKNESS`). It then uses nested loops to draw the horizontal and vertical lines for a `3x3` grid at a specified position on the page.
      * **Page 2 (Image with Grid):** It adds a second new page. The script uses `c.drawImage()` to place your image onto the canvas, scaled and positioned to match the grid on the previous page. Then, it sets the stroke color to white and a thinner line thickness (`OVERLAY_LINE_THICKNESS`) and draws the exact same grid on top of the image.
      * **Page Number:** For both pages, it calculates the position to center the text "X/30" at the bottom of the page and draws it.
      * `c.showPage()` and `c.save()` are crucial commands that finalize each page and save the entire document once the loop is complete.

After running this script, you will have a single `drawing_flipbook.pdf` file in your main directory. You can transfer this file to your iPhone and open it in any PDF viewer. It will contain a two-page spread for each day's drawing, meeting all your requirements.
