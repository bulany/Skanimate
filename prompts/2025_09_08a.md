This works pretty good but could you make the following changes mainly to the index.html file so I can copy and paste the whole file with the changes:
1. Please add in that code that loads the manifest and service worker
2. Can you make the grid much simpler: it should just be a 3x3 grid (9 squares total) consisting of white lines overlayed on the image and obviously so the center square is exactly centered. I don't know if its easier to do this by specifying 3x3 somewhere instead of calculating in pixels.
3. Add a reset button to set the timer back to 5 minutes
4. Pay a bit more attention to the layout: I think the square image (it will always be square no matter what the actual pixel dimensions are) should be right at the top then all the controls and displays can be layed out underneath in the free space on the phone screen.
5. There should be another 'show grid' (or similar label) button that toggles a special mode where just the grid is shown maybe as black lines (with a variable to adjust the thickness but probably 2px is good to start) on a white background. I want to be able to press this button and then put the phone under my notebook page and trace the lines of the grid (I have checked that if the image is high contrast I can see it faintly through the notebook pages).
6. Can you double check the service worker caching method. On desktop it seems to work fine. On the phone it seems I have to tap through the advance buttons to view each image before it is loaded into the cache and I haven't really tested if I reboot the phone... I did stop the server on the computer which is how I know that images that weren't viewed yet wont display. If that's a hard bug to fix don't worry about it too much - its pretty close and I guess I don't want to break things more.
Thanks!
