I love this creative project! You're essentially building a daily drawing practice with video references and a flipbook outcome. Let me break this down into a step-by-step tutorial that will get you up and running quickly.Now let me create the actual drawing app for you:Perfect! Here's what I've created for you:

## Quick Start Guide

**Follow these steps to get your first drawing session working:**

1. **Set up your tools** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
   ```

2. **Download a test video** (2 minutes):
   ```bash
   yt-dlp "YOUR_YOUTUBE_SHORT_URL" -o "skateboard_source.%(ext)s"
   ```

3. **Extract and process frames** (3 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Replace the crop values based on your video dimensions
   ffmpeg -i skateboard_source.mp4 -ss 83 -t 2 -vf "fps=15,crop=1080:1080:0:420,scale=800:800,format=gray" -q:v 2 frame_%02d.png
   ```

4. **Set up the app** (2 minutes):
   - Create folder: `skateboard-drawing-app`
   - Create subfolder: `images`
   - Move your `frame_*.png` files into the `images` folder
   - Save the HTML app I created as `index.html` in the main folder

5. **Test on your iPhone** (2 minutes):
   - Transfer the folder to your iPhone (via AirDrop, iCloud, etc.)
   - Open `index.html` in Safari
   - Add to Home Screen for easy access

## Key Features of the App:

- **Offline-first**: Works completely without internet
- **Auto-progression**: Advances to next image each new day
- **5-minute timer**: Pause/resume functionality
- **Grid overlay**: Toggle on/off with red grid lines
- **Progress tracking**: Remembers where you left off
- **Manual navigation**: Can go back/forward through images
- **Full-screen**: Optimized for iPhone drawing reference

## For Your Notebook Grid:

I recommend the **impression method**: Draw a perfect grid on cardstock, place it under your notebook page, and trace over it firmly with a pencil. This creates subtle guidelines without adding extra marks to your drawing.

The app displays a 12x12 grid by default - you can modify this in the JavaScript if you prefer different grid density.

This workflow will give you immediate feedback at each step, so you can see progress quickly and adjust as needed. The beauty is that once set up, your daily routine is just: open app → start timer → draw for 5 minutes → done!
