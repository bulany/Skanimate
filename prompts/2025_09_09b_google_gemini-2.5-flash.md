Of course\! Here is the modified Python script to generate your PDF using A4 page dimensions and millimeters.

### Modified Python Script for A4 PDF Generation

This script uses the `A4` constant from `reportlab` and converts all dimensions to millimeters (`mm`). The logic remains the same, but the units and page size are updated for your A4 notebook.

```python
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from reportlab.lib.units import mm
from PIL import Image
import os

# --- Configuration ---
IMG_DIR = "images"
OUTPUT_PDF = "drawing_flipbook_A4.pdf"
NUM_IMAGES = 30
GRID_DIVISIONS = 3

# Grid dimensions and position in millimeters
# A4 page size is 210 x 297 mm
GRID_SIZE_MM = 120 # Square grid size
PAGE_WIDTH, PAGE_HEIGHT = A4
GRID_X_MM = (PAGE_WIDTH - GRID_SIZE_MM) / 2 # Center horizontally
GRID_Y_MM = 297 - GRID_SIZE_MM - 30 # Adjust this value to position the grid from the top
GRID_LINE_THICKNESS = 4 # for black grid
OVERLAY_LINE_THICKNESS = 1 # for white grid

def create_pdf():
    c = canvas.Canvas(OUTPUT_PDF, pagesize=A4)

    # Calculate grid dimensions in Reportlab units (points)
    grid_size_pt = GRID_SIZE_MM * mm
    grid_x_pt = GRID_X_MM * mm
    grid_y_pt = GRID_Y_MM * mm

    for i in range(1, NUM_IMAGES + 1):
        img_filename = f"output{i:02d}.png"
        img_path = os.path.join(IMG_DIR, img_filename)

        if not os.path.exists(img_path):
            print(f"Warning: Image file not found: {img_path}. Skipping.")
            continue

        # --- Page 1: White page with black grid for tracing ---
        c.showPage()
        
        # Draw the black grid
        c.setStrokeColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black
        c.setLineWidth(GRID_LINE_THICKNESS)
        
        step_size = grid_size_pt / GRID_DIVISIONS
        
        # Horizontal lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            y_pos = grid_y_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(grid_x_pt, y_pos, grid_x_pt + grid_size_pt, y_pos)
            
        # Vertical lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            x_pos = grid_x_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(x_pos, grid_y_pt, x_pos, grid_y_pt + grid_size_pt)
            
        # Add page number
        c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
        c.setFillColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black text
        page_text = f"{i}/{NUM_IMAGES}"
        text_width = c.stringWidth(page_text, "Helvetica", 14)
        c.drawString((PAGE_WIDTH * mm - text_width) / 2, grid_y_pt / 2, page_text)
        
        # --- Page 2: Image with white grid overlay ---
        c.showPage()
        
        # Draw the image
        c.drawImage(img_path, grid_x_pt, grid_y_pt, width=grid_size_pt, height=grid_size_pt)

        # Draw the white grid overlay
        c.setStrokeColorRGB(1, 1, 1) # White
        c.setLineWidth(OVERLAY_LINE_THICKNESS)
        
        # Horizontal lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            y_pos = grid_y_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(grid_x_pt, y_pos, grid_x_pt + grid_size_pt, y_pos)
        
        # Vertical lines
        for j in range(GRID_DIVISIONS + 1):
            x_pos = grid_x_pt + j * step_size
            c.line(x_pos, grid_y_pt, x_pos, grid_y_pt + grid_size_pt)
            
        # Add page number
        c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
        c.setFillColorRGB(0, 0, 0) # Black text
        text_width = c.stringWidth(page_text, "Helvetica", 14)
        c.drawString((PAGE_WIDTH * mm - text_width) / 2, grid_y_pt / 2, page_text)

    c.save()
    print(f"PDF '{OUTPUT_PDF}' created successfully with {NUM_IMAGES * 2} pages.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_pdf()
```

The key changes are:

  * **Page Size:** The line `from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4` and `canvas.Canvas(OUTPUT_PDF, pagesize=A4)` set the document to the standard A4 size (210 x 297 mm).
  * **Units:** The line `from reportlab.lib.units import mm` imports the millimeter unit, which is then used to define all dimensions.
  * **Dimensions:** The variables `GRID_SIZE_MM`, `GRID_X_MM`, and `GRID_Y_MM` are now defined in millimeters, and the calculations for centering the grid and text are based on the A4 dimensions. The line `grid_x_pt = GRID_X_MM * mm` converts these millimeter values to points, which is the internal unit used by ReportLab.
