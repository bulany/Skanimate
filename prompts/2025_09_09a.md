How easy would it be to author a PDF instead of a webapp... that is, given the folder of 30 images, can you give me a script that generates the following PDF:
For each of the 30 images, have two pages: the first page is all white with a square grid that is at the top of the page - the grid is all white with black lines (probably a little thicker). I will open the pdf on my phone and put this page under my page to trace the grid... so the black needs to be thick enough that I can see it in contrast to the white background. The second page is the image itself - it is in the same position as the grid from the previous page but this time it has a grid imposed on top of it... this is important: the grids are all 3x3 ie just nine squares. The grid imposed on top of the image is with thin white lines the center of which would match exactly with that of black grid lines from the previous page. So each day I open the PDF, I scroll to the page with the grid, trace my grid and then scroll to the image for that day and draw it. In the clear area at the bottom of each page is written the number of the image in the series e.g. "3/30"
