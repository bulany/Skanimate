Can you help me achieve a workflow which allows me to do the following:
Each new day, I unlock my iPhone and I open an 'app' or website... 
The app shows me a full screen black and white still image of a skateboarder with a number in one of the corners "3/30". 
The image is full screen (ie there is nothing else on the screen except the number label) but it is a square aspect ratio... so parts of the screen outside the square image can be used for the number label and the timer countdown.
The black and white image has a subtle grid (maybe in red or another colour) layed over it. Maybe you can choose between a subtle grid and just dots in the corners of where the grid lines intersect.
I know the physical dimensions of this grid and I have a same size copy drawn in the the corner of each page of my notebook.
When I tap a timer button it starts a countdown timer for 5 minutes (that is displayed somewhere)... this timer can be paused and restarted by retapping the button. 
As the timer ticks down I draw the image as best as I can in my notebook.
I draw one image everyday and each day when I open the app I can choose between say 30 images that are set up for me to draw.
The 30 images come from video footage which I have preprocessed (see later). 
After 30 days of drawing one series of images I should have a little flipbook in the corner of my notebook which I can flip through.
I have some kind of a system that at the beginning of a series of images I can copy out the grid (maybe a grid stamp but most probably will be a grid drawn on paper that I go over with soft pencil and make an impression in my notebook).
At the end of the 30 days I can set up another round of images to draw.
The app or system on the phone needs to work totally offline (including remembering which image I was up to) as I want to be able to draw whenever I get 5 minutes... which might be when there is no internet.
As for setting up the images, I would like to use yt-dlp with a url of say a youtube short that I have in mind to download some footage.
Then I'm imagining there would be someway to use ffmpeg or similar to specify a start time and a stop time and then a number of equally spaced frames to store as separate images. E.g. I choose 1m23s -> 1m25s and 30 images... the workflow gets the images and also turns them to grey scale... if its easier to overlay the grid it does so here otherwise I guess the app can handle it... but maybe it would be good to do it here and then the "app" could simply be a folder of files on my phone (although I wonder if that's easy to transfer and quick to pick up on the image number I left off on if my phone is reset between days).
Anyway I probably need to review the images once they are cut from the footage to make sure I have what I need... oh and I want the images to be a square cutout of a section of the frame (youtube shorts often have a rectangular aspect ratio)... I might need to adjust the size and offset of this square cutout - so if you could suggest how ffmpeg might achieve this e.g. with command line parameters or if there is a better way (I guess because probably visually getting an idea of a clip frame with Apple Mac preview or simllar would be easier... but how to transfer these dimensions and offset to the cutting and processing tool?)

Anyway it would be great if you could give me some ideas and suggestions ideally structured as a tutorial that I can follow step by step where most steps can give me rapid feedback and a sense that I am progressing toward the end goal. E.g. the first step might be something like 'Use yt-dlp with the following command line to download the video at your selected URL... once the file is saved, have a look using the default viewer on macos... next, try out ffmpeg with the following command line and see how it cuts some frames... etc'

Thank you!
